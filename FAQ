Q  How does clbuild differ from asdf-install?

A  clbuild includes a list of selected libraries and applications and
their well-known locations, and downloads the newest version or
CVS/SVN/darcs repositories if possible. It can also build SBCL for you
and includes convenient commands to start various applications.

In contrast, asdf-install can install any software listed on Cliki. It
always downloads release tarballs. (It is up to the user to hunt down
the trustworthy PGP keys as a protection agains malicous wiki entries.)


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q  My favourite application is not supported. How can I add it?

A  Just add it to clbuild/wnpp-projects. Please send a note to the
mailing list so that we can include it, too.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q  Does it work on cygwin?

A  It used to work on cygwin. You need to recompile SBCL with an
ASDF patch for shortcut support first. Beware that cygwin support is
tested only occasionally and might not be complete anymore.

To starts clbuild's slime, make sure to use the Windows version of
Emacs, not cygwin's Emacs.

Q  Is the `dependencies' file auto-generated?

Yes, use "clbuild record-dependencies" to rebuild-it.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q  The `dependencies' file is broken!

This file is an educated guess and sometimes not perfect.  We prefer to
err on the side of too many dependencies rather than too few.

However, the following situations are NOT necessarily bugs:

  - circular dependencies
    (cffi depends on trivial-features, which depends on cffi itself.
    That is NOT a problem.

  - non-transitive dependencies
    (if A depends on B, which depends on C, it does NOT follow that A
    depends on C.)


Make sure to distinguish between project dependencies and system
dependencies.

The following process computes the "project dependencies" of a project
FOO:

  - look for all files named clbuild/source/FOO/*.asd and load them

    (Except for some special projects that force us to scan recursively
    for asd files.)

  - for each system BAR that we found a file FOO/bar.asd for, compute
    the systems that BAR depends on.

    ASDF provides no function that I am aware of to find those
    dependencies, so we scan the in-order-to slot to make an educated
    guess what those dependencies are.

    (As an extra exception, we sometimes add dependencies at this point,
    for example to force mcclim to always depend on cffi, no matter
    whether the caller currently has gtkairo enabled or not.)

  - for each such system that is a dependency, map the system back to
    its asd file, and if that asd file is found somewhere in
    clbuild/source/BAZ/, consider it to be part of project BAZ

  - The projects found in the last step are the dependencies of FOO.

This process implies that dependencies between projects are not
transitive.

For example, the project `babel' depends on the project `rt' because the
system BABEL-TEST depends on the system RT.

But the system HUNCHENTOOT depends only on BABEL, not BABEL-TEST, so the
project `hunchentoot' does not depend on the project `rt'.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q  Why is clbuild written in shell?  Lisp is so much better.

There are many answers to this question.  Here are just a few of them:

  - Luke originally wrote clbuild as a shell script.

  - clbuild is not a mere shell script.  At least `recompile' and
    `record-dependencies' are now written in Lisp.

  - We basically just call out to darcs, git, cvs, and svn anyway.

  - Thanks to the shell script, we can install lisp projects before
    having built a clean SBCL, and without having to worry whether the
    Lisp in $PATH is good enough.

  - Building SBCL from a shell script seems like a natural thing to do.

  - Other projects have tried to explore different parts of the design
    space for lisp software installers.  There is cl-librarian written
    in Lisp, clget written in Perl, and so on.
